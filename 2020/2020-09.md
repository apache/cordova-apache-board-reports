## Status report for the Apache Cordova project - September 2020

## Description: 
 - A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
 
## Activity
 - note from last board report:
  jm: There is little in this report about community health and
      growth. It would be good to see more on that in your next
      report.

 
## Issues: 
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Health report: 

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green - failures are usually due to external service issues that do device testing. Our nightly builds have been extremely stable.
