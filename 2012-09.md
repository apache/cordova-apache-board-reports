Cordova

Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project entered incubation as Apache Callback in October, 2011, before changing its name to Cordova. Cordova is an active community with contributors and committers from many different backgrounds. The first Apache release is expected to be ready shortly, after which Cordova should be ready to graduate.
