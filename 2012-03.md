Cordova

Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project entered incubation as Apache Callback in October, 2011, before changing its name to Cordova.

Our aim for Feb was to ship an official Apache release, but a few issues remain. We're confident 1.6 will mark our first release.

- completed code migration to Cordova name
- weinre nowing running on nodejs
- cordova-js migration complete for android, underway for other platforms
- aim to new code release cutting tool called `coho`
- launched http://incubator.apache.org/cordova (nice work yohei)
- excellent update to the wiki on contribution (fil, michael)
- Denis Kormalev (dkormalev) voted as committer
- Longwei Su (longwei) voted as committer

Graduation concerns:
