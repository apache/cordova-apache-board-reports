Cordova

December was a busy month. Lots of updates to the code base and our working toolchain. 

We would particularly like to thank infra for all the work getting us setup with git. We really appreciate the effort and valuable discussion surrounding it. It is this sort of attention to community that makes us grateful to be members of the Apache community.

* shipped 1.3 with full windows phone support (NOTE: this was not an ASF release; this is next for us)
* BlackBerry Playbook support
* started migration to Cordova name
* git migration complete
* battery events api (http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.3.0/phonegap_events_events.md.html#Events)
* first version of the project web site up

Graduation concerns:

* Complete the migration to Apache infrastructure
* Make an official Apache release
* Grant committership to new contributors
