Cordova

Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project entered incubation as
Apache Callback in October, 2011, before changing its name to Cordova.

January could be characterized as the month where we hit our stride
on Apache infra. Tonnes of updates to the code. Huge activity on the
mailing list. Two new committers voted in.

Currently, we recognize the majority of commits are currently coming
from Adobe and IBM actively pushing to our repositories on git-wip-us
(6 and 4 active pushers respectively). We aim to add more contributors
in coming releases as per The Apache Way.

  - shipped 1.4 (NOTE: we aim to make 1.5 our first official apache release)
  - continued code migration to Cordova name
  - new Apache Cordova logo!
  - project web site design iteration
  - new automated build system code named 'coho'
  - Yohei Shimomae voted as committer
  - Steve Gill voted as committer
  - made progress on the IP review

Graduation concerns:

  - Complete the IP review (source headers, license metadata, etc.)
  - Continue to foster more community committers
  - Ship an official Apache release
