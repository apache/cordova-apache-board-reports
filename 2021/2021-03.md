## Status report for the Apache Cordova project - March 2021

## Description: 
 - A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
 
## Activity
Recent work has been around keeping up with recent changes to iOS and Android, our most used platforms.  We continue to work towards reducing technical debt, and 'running the business'

## Issues: 
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Health report: 

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green - failures are usually due to external service issues that do device testing. Our nightly builds have been extremely stable.

ASF Project Statistics gives the project a Community Health Score (Chi): 4.7 (Healthy)

We are still only seeing contributions from a small group of dedicated individuals. This makes it harder to make large changes. All the large corporate sponsored development has ceased, but the project continues to see good traffic, and usage has been stable.

The cordova-cli, the base tool used for creating/building/running gets 125k downloads a week on npm, and has been consistent for the last year.  Various core plugins see usage in the 50-80k/wk range.

Our primary channel for helping, and hearing from users is via our #slack community, which has ~4k users and continues to be fairly active.  There has been some interest in also exploring github discussions.
